# Microservice for Generating Embedding Vectors

This microservice allows users to effortlessly create a **Vector Database** by following a series of steps. By leveraging advanced text processing and embedding models, users can build a powerful database enriched with metadata and optimized for efficient querying.

## Steps to Generate a Vector Database

### Step 1: Upload Folder/Files
- Begin by uploading the folder or files containing the text documents you want to include in the Vector Database.

### Step 2: Add Metadata
- Extracted text from the uploaded documents will be used to generate metadata. This metadata enhances the information associated with each document in the Vector Database.

### Step 3: Select Embedding Model
- Choose an embedding model that best suits your needs. The selected model will be employed to convert textual information into numerical vectors, enabling advanced similarity searches.

### Step 4: Customize Text Chunks
- Based on the chosen embedding model, receive recommendations for creating text chunks. Tailor the size of these chunks to optimize the performance of your Vector Database.

### Step 5: Choose Vector Database (Index)
- Select a vector database for indexing purposes. Options include popular solutions like **FAISS**, **Pinecone**, etc. This step ensures that your Vector Database is efficiently organized for seamless retrieval of relevant information.
